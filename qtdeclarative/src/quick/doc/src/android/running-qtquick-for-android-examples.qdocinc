    The Qt Quick for Android API examples are provided as Android Studio projects.
    The project folders are found in your Qt install location.

    For example, under the default Windows install path, they are found here:
    \badcode \QtVersion
        C:\Qt\Examples\Qt-/1\platforms\android
    \endcode
